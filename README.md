# Employee-Tracker

## Description

I wrote this project as an easy way to update information about employees and business roles. This way, someone does not need to leave the terminal to add, view, or update their database. In this project, I learned how to write and call SQL queries from a JS file.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you must npm i inquirer@8.2.4, dotenv, mysql2, and console.table.

## Usage

In order to use this run "node index" in the terminal and follow the prompts.
